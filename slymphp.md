## 🚀 About SlymPHP

**SlymPHP** is a lightweight PHP micro-framework designed for developers who prioritize **simplicity**, **minimalism**, and **direct control** over their codebase. Whether you're building CRUD applications, REST APIs, or hobby SPAs, SlymPHP offers a clean and intuitive starting point without the overhead of larger PHP ecosystems.

---

## 🌱 Philosophy

SlymPHP follows the **“clone-and-code”** approach.  
No need for Composer, external dependencies, or boilerplate bloat — just clone the repo and start editing.

The workflow and structure are **heavily inspired by Django**, while the underlying codebase takes cues from **Prahlad Yeri’s Minimal MVC**.
