## 🚀 About the Project

This project was developed exclusively for the **Technical & Cultural Fest (Laasya '23)** at the **College of Engineering Muttathara (CEM)**. It served as a full-fledged event registration and management system, designed to streamline and digitize the entire fest workflow.

The system was custom-built using **PHP 7 Core**, and equipped with admin tools, payment integration, registration management, and even barcode-based entry passes. It was actively used by event coordinators and managed from an internal admin CMS.

> 🔐 The project is proprietary and handed over to the fest coordination team. It is no longer live or publicly hosted.
