## 🚀 About the Project

**CG-IFMS** (Chhattisgarh - Integrated Financial Management System) is a modern, visually enriched landing page concept designed for a government finance portal. This was developed purely as a **reimagined frontend interface** based on public-facing design trends in government digital infrastructure.

The project includes a fully responsive **landing page** and a **secure-looking login interface** for officials or registered users. While this is a UI/UX concept and not connected to any backend service, it reflects the standards expected in real-world public sector web applications.
